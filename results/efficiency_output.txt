All metrics on the SAME test set of games.

Bookmaker implied probabilities vs outcomes
  Accuracy      :  0.6782
  Brier score   :  0.2051
  Log-loss      :  0.5960
  Sharpness (std of p):  0.2260

Logistic regression model vs outcomes
  Accuracy      :  0.6806
  Brier score   :  0.2049
  Log-loss      :  0.5953
  Sharpness (std of p):  0.2188

Interpretation hints:
  • LOWER Brier and log-loss = better probabilistic predictions.
  • HIGHER sharpness = more confident probabilities.
  • If model beats bookmaker on Brier/log-loss, there may be exploitable signal.
